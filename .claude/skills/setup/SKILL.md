# NanoClaw Setup

Run setup steps automatically. Only pause when user action is required (channel authentication, configuration choices). Setup uses `bash setup.sh` for bootstrap, then `npx tsx setup/index.ts --step <name>` for all other steps. Steps emit structured status blocks to stdout. Verbose logs go to `logs/setup.log`.

**Principle:** When something is broken or missing, fix it. Don't tell the user to go fix it themselves unless it genuinely requires their manual action (e.g. authenticating a channel, pasting a secret token). If a dependency is missing, install it. If a service won't start, diagnose and repair. Ask the user for permission when needed, then do the work.

**UX Note:** Use `AskUserQuestion` for all user-facing questions.

## 0. Git & Fork Setup

Check the git remote configuration to ensure the user has a fork and upstream is configured.

Run:
- `git remote -v`

**Case A — `origin` points to `qwibitai/nanoclaw` (user cloned directly):**

The user cloned instead of forking. AskUserQuestion: "You cloned NanoClaw directly. We recommend forking so you can push your customizations. Would you like to set up a fork?"
- Fork now (recommended) — walk them through it
- Continue without fork — they'll only have local changes

If fork: instruct the user to fork `qwibitai/nanoclaw` on GitHub (they need to do this in their browser), then ask them for their GitHub username. Run:
```bash
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/<their-username>/nanoclaw.git
git push --force origin main
```
Verify with `git remote -v`.

If continue without fork: add upstream so they can still pull updates:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw.git
```

**Case B — `origin` points to user's fork, no `upstream` remote:**

Add upstream:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw.git
```

**Case C — both `origin` (user's fork) and `upstream` (qwibitai) exist:**

Already configured. Continue.

**Verify:** `git remote -v` should show `origin` → user's repo, `upstream` → `qwibitai/nanoclaw.git`.

## 1. Bootstrap (Node.js + Dependencies)

Run `bash setup.sh` and parse the status block.

- If NODE_OK=false → Node.js is missing or too old. Use `AskUserQuestion: Would you like me to install Node.js 22?` If confirmed:
  - macOS: `brew install node@22` (if brew available) or install nvm then `nvm install 22`
  - Linux: `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`, or nvm
  - After installing Node, re-run `bash setup.sh`
- If DEPS_OK=false → Read `logs/setup.log`. Try: delete `node_modules`, re-run `bash setup.sh`. If native module build fails, install build tools (`xcode-select --install` on macOS, `build-essential` on Linux), then retry.
- If NATIVE_OK=false → better-sqlite3 failed to load. Install build tools and re-run.
- Record PLATFORM and IS_WSL for later steps.

## 2. Check Environment

Run `npx tsx setup/index.ts --step environment` and parse the status block.

- If HAS_AUTH=true → WhatsApp is already configured, note for step 5
- If HAS_REGISTERED_GROUPS=true → note existing config, offer to skip or reconfigure
- Record APPLE_CONTAINER and DOCKER values for step 3

## 2a. Timezone

Run `npx tsx setup/index.ts --step timezone` and parse the status block.

- If NEEDS_USER_INPUT=true → The system timezone could not be autodetected (e.g. POSIX-style TZ like `IST-2`). AskUserQuestion: "What is your timezone?" with common options (America/New_York, Europe/London, Asia/Jerusalem, Asia/Tokyo) and an "Other" escape. Then re-run: `npx tsx setup/index.ts --step timezone -- --tz <their-answer>`.
- If STATUS=success → Timezone is configured. Note RESOLVED_TZ for reference.

## 3. Container Runtime

### 3a. Choose runtime

Check the preflight results for `APPLE_CONTAINER` and `DOCKER`, and the PLATFORM from step 1.

- PLATFORM=linux → Docker (only option)
- PLATFORM=macos + APPLE_CONTAINER=installed → Use `AskUserQuestion: Docker (cross-platform) or Apple Container (native macOS)?` If Apple Container, run `/convert-to-apple-container` now, then skip to 3c.
- PLATFORM=macos + APPLE_CONTAINER=not_found → Docker

### 3a-docker. Install Docker

- DOCKER=running → continue to 4b
- DOCKER=installed_not_running → start Docker: `open -a Docker` (macOS) or `sudo systemctl start docker` (Linux). Wait 15s, re-check with `docker info`.
- DOCKER=not_found → Use `AskUserQuestion: Docker is required for running agents. Would you like me to install it?` If confirmed:
  - macOS: install via `brew install --cask docker`, then `open -a Docker` and wait for it to start. If brew not available, direct to Docker Desktop download at https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop
  - Linux: install with `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh && sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. Note: user may need to log out/in for group membership.

### 3b. Apple Container conversion gate (if needed)

**If the chosen runtime is Apple Container**, you MUST check whether the source code has already been converted from Docker to Apple Container. Do NOT skip this step. Run:

```bash
grep -q "CONTAINER_RUNTIME_BIN = 'container'" src/container-runtime.ts && echo "ALREADY_CONVERTED" || echo "NEEDS_CONVERSION"
```

**If NEEDS_CONVERSION**, the source code still uses Docker as the runtime. You MUST run the `/convert-to-apple-container` skill NOW, before proceeding to the build step.

**If ALREADY_CONVERTED**, the code already uses Apple Container. Continue to 3c.

**If the chosen runtime is Docker**, no conversion is needed. Continue to 3c.

### 3c. Build and test

Run `npx tsx setup/index.ts --step container -- --runtime <chosen>` and parse the status block.

**If BUILD_OK=false:** Read `logs/setup.log` tail for the build error.
- Cache issue (stale layers): `docker builder prune -f` (Docker) or `container builder stop && container builder rm && container builder start` (Apple Container). Retry.
- Dockerfile syntax or missing files: diagnose from the log and fix, then retry.

**If TEST_OK=false but BUILD_OK=true:** The image built but won't run. Check logs — common cause is runtime not fully started. Wait a moment and retry the test.

## 4. Claude Authentication (No Script)

If HAS_ENV=true from step 2, read `.env` and check for `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. If present, confirm with user: keep or reconfigure?

AskUserQuestion: Claude subscription (Pro/Max) vs Anthropic API key?

**Subscription:** Tell user to run `claude setup-token` in another terminal, copy the token, add `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=<token>` to `.env`. Do NOT collect the token in chat.

**API key:** Tell user to add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<key>` to `.env`.

## 5. Set Up Channels

AskUserQuestion (multiSelect): Which messaging channels do you want to enable?
- WhatsApp (authenticates via QR code or pairing code)
- Telegram (authenticates via bot token from @BotFather)
- Slack (authenticates via Slack app with Socket Mode)
- Discord (authenticates via Discord bot token)

**Delegate to each selected channel's own skill.** Each channel skill handles its own code installation, authentication, registration, and JID resolution. This avoids duplicating channel-specific logic and ensures JIDs are always correct.

For each selected channel, invoke its skill:

- **WhatsApp:** Invoke `/add-whatsapp`
- **Telegram:** Invoke `/add-telegram`
- **Slack:** Invoke `/add-slack`
- **Discord:** Invoke `/add-discord`

Each skill will:
1. Install the channel code (via `git merge` of the skill branch)
2. Collect credentials/tokens and write to `.env`
3. Authenticate (WhatsApp QR/pairing, or verify token-based connection)
4. Register the chat with the correct JID format
5. Build and verify

**After all channel skills complete**, install dependencies and rebuild — channel merges may introduce new packages:

```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

If the build fails, read the error output and fix it (usually a missing dependency). Then continue to step 6.

## 6. Mount Allowlist

AskUserQuestion: Agent access to external directories?

**No:** `npx tsx setup/index.ts --step mounts -- --empty`
**Yes:** Collect paths/permissions. `npx tsx setup/index.ts --step mounts -- --json '{"allowedRoots":[...],"blockedPatterns":[],"nonMainReadOnly":true}'`

## 7. Start Service

If service already running: unload first.
- macOS: `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist`
- Linux: `systemctl --user stop nanoclaw` (or `systemctl stop nanoclaw` if root)

Run `npx tsx setup/index.ts --step service` and parse the status block.

**If FALLBACK=wsl_no_systemd:** WSL without systemd detected. Tell user they can either enable systemd in WSL (`echo -e "[boot]\nsystemd=true" | sudo tee /etc/wsl.conf` then restart WSL) or use the generated `start-nanoclaw.sh` wrapper.

**If DOCKER_GROUP_STALE=true:** The user was added to the docker group after their session started — the systemd service can't reach the Docker socket. Ask user to run these two commands:

1. Immediate fix: `sudo setfacl -m u:$(whoami):rw /var/run/docker.sock`
2. Persistent fix (re-applies after every Docker restart):
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/socket-acl.conf << 'EOF'
[Service]
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/setfacl -m u:USERNAME:rw /var/run/docker.sock
EOF
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
Replace `USERNAME` with the actual username (from `whoami`). Run the two `sudo` commands separately — the `tee` heredoc first, then `daemon-reload`. After user confirms setfacl ran, re-run the service step.

**If SERVICE_LOADED=false:**
- Read `logs/setup.log` for the error.
- macOS: check `launchctl list | grep nanoclaw`. If PID=`-` and status non-zero, read `logs/nanoclaw.error.log`.
- Linux: check `systemctl --user status nanoclaw`.
- Re-run the service step after fixing.

## 8. Verify

Run `npx tsx setup/index.ts --step verify` and parse the status block.

**If STATUS=failed, fix each:**
- SERVICE=stopped → `npm run build`, then restart: `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw` (macOS) or `systemctl --user restart nanoclaw` (Linux) or `bash start-nanoclaw.sh` (WSL nohup)
- SERVICE=not_found → re-run step 7
- CREDENTIALS=missing → re-run step 4
- CHANNEL_AUTH shows `not_found` for any channel → re-invoke that channel's skill (e.g. `/add-telegram`)
- REGISTERED_GROUPS=0 → re-invoke the channel skills from step 5
- MOUNT_ALLOWLIST=missing → `npx tsx setup/index.ts --step mounts -- --empty`

Tell user to test: send a message in their registered chat. Show: `tail -f logs/nanoclaw.log`

## Troubleshooting

**Service not starting:** Check `logs/nanoclaw.error.log`. Common: wrong Node path (re-run step 7), missing `.env` (step 4), missing channel credentials (re-invoke channel skill).

**Container agent fails ("Claude Code process exited with code 1"):** Ensure the container runtime is running — `open -a Docker` (macOS Docker), `container system start` (Apple Container), or `sudo systemctl start docker` (Linux). Check container logs in `groups/main/logs/container-*.log`.

**No response to messages:** Check trigger pattern. Main channel doesn't need prefix. Check DB: `npx tsx setup/index.ts --step verify`. Check `logs/nanoclaw.log`.

**Channel not connecting:** Verify the channel's credentials are set in `.env`. Channels auto-enable when their credentials are present. For WhatsApp: check `store/auth/creds.json` exists. For token-based channels: check token values in `.env`. Restart the service after any `.env` change.

**Unload service:** macOS: `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist` | Linux: `systemctl --user stop nanoclaw`


## 9. Diagnostics

1. Use the Read tool to read `.claude/skills/setup/diagnostics.md`.
2. Follow every step in that file before completing setup.
