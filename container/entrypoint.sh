# NanoClaw agent container entrypoint.
#
# The host passes initial session parameters via stdin as a single JSON blob,
# then the agent-runner opens the session DBs at /workspace/{inbound,outbound}.db
# and enters its poll loop. All further IO flows through those DBs.
#
# We capture stdin to a file first so /tmp/input.json is available for
# post-mortem inspection if the container exits unexpectedly, then exec bun
# so that bun becomes PID 1's direct child (under tini) and receives signals.
