# Analytics: Tracking

Guides analytics implementation: GA4 setup, event tracking, conversions, and data quality. Applies to web and app tracking across marketing channels.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## User ID

- **Purpose**: Cross-device, cross-session user identification
- **Implementation**: Set `user_id` when user is identified (e.g., login); send to GA4
- **Benefit**: Accurate attribution across sessions; better audience building

## CTA Attribution (Article ROI)

Track CTA clicks on key articles to measure content ROI:

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Event per CTA** | e.g., `cta_click` with `content_url`, `content_type` |
| **Conversion** | Mark as conversion in GA4 for attribution |
| **Use** | Compare high vs low performers; optimize CTA placement and copy |

See **seo-monitoring** for article database and benchmark context.

## Infrastructure Requirements

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Data warehouse** | Centralized data; BI reporting |
| **Event tracking** | User behavior; funnel mapping |
| **Attribution** | Ad pixels; attribution model; impression-to-sale tracking |

**Optimization flow**: Clean UTM + conversion events → attribution reports → optimize channel mix.

## Scope

- **GA4**: Web data stream, gtag.js, configuration
- **User ID**: Cross-device, cross-session identification
- **CTA attribution**: Per-article conversion tracking for content ROI
- **Events**: Recommended and custom events
- **Conversions**: Key events, parameters
- **Quality**: Naming, testing, validation

## GA4 Setup

### Prerequisites

- Google Analytics property and web data stream
- Google tag (gtag.js) on all pages
- Measurement ID (e.g., `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

### Enhanced Measurement

Enable in Admin > Data Streams > Enhanced Measurement for automatic tracking of:

- Page views, scrolls, outbound clicks
- Site search, file downloads
- Video engagement (YouTube)

## Event Tracking

### Event Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Automatically collected** | page_view, first_visit, session_start |
| **Enhanced measurement** | scroll, click, file_download, etc. |
| **Recommended** | purchase, sign_up, search, etc. |
| **Custom** | Business-specific actions |

### Naming Conventions

- **Length**: <=40 characters (GA4 hard limit; longer names are not logged)
- **Format**: `snake_case`, lowercase
- **Verb first**: `download_pdf`, `submit_form`, `video_play`
- **Context**: `pricing_page_scroll` vs generic `scroll`

### gtag.js Syntax

```javascript
gtag('event', '<event_name>', {
  <parameter_name>: <value>,
  // e.g. value: 99.99, currency: 'USD'
});
```

Place below the Google tag snippet. Events fire on page load or user action (e.g., button click).

### Recommended Events

| Event | Use | Key Parameters |
|-------|-----|----------------|
| `purchase` | E-commerce | value, currency, items |
| `sign_up` | Registration | method |
| `login` | Login | method |
| `search` | Site search | search_term |
| `view_item` | Product view | items |
| `add_to_cart` | Add to cart | items |

### Custom Events

- Focus on 15-25 meaningful events aligned with KPIs
- Add parameters for context (e.g., `content_type`, `item_id`)
- Avoid tracking everything; prioritize quality over quantity

## Conversions (Key Events)

- Mark important events as conversions in GA4 Admin
- Use for attribution, audiences, and reporting
- Typical: purchase, sign_up, lead, contact

## Attribution & Conversion Optimization

Attribution models determine how conversion credit is assigned across touchpoints. Use attribution data to optimize ads and growth channels.

| Model | Use |
|-------|-----|
| **Data-driven** (GA4 default) | ML assigns credit by actual contribution; best for multi-touch journeys |
| **Last-click** | 100% to final touchpoint; simple but undervalues awareness/consideration |

**Optimization flow**: Clean UTM (source, medium, campaign) + conversion events → GA4 attribution reports → compare channels by attributed conversions → reallocate budget to ads/channels that drive results. Inconsistent UTM fragments data; multi-touch attribution requires reliable touchpoint data.

## Testing & Validation

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| **Realtime** | See events as they fire |
| **DebugView** | Detailed event/parameter inspection; requires debug mode |
| **GA4 Debug mode** | `gtag('config', 'G-XXX', { 'debug_mode': true });` or GTM preview |

- Test before launch; verify parameters and naming
- Check for duplicate events, missing values

## Output Format

- **Event list** (name, trigger, parameters)
- **Implementation** notes (gtag or GTM)
- **Conversion** mapping
- **Testing** checklist
